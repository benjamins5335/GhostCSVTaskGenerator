# GhostCSVTaskGenerator

Quick script made by me that creates tasks for ghost in a csv file very quickly. Designed for surprise SNKRS drops so tasks can be made in around 10-60 seconds. I am by no means a good coder so there's probably an easier way to do things, but it works. If you have problems opening the script or getting it running feel free to dm me on twitter @benjamins5335. But honestly, googling problems would be easier

# Setup:

1. Download Python 3 (I use 3.6 so if it doesn't work then try using 3.6)
2. Enter all checkout profiles in ghostprofiles.txt
3. Enter all accounts into ghostaccounts.txt
4. Enter all proxies into ghostproxies.txt

# Steps for running

1, Run the script
2. Answer the questions when prompted
3. You will be told when it's done; look at ghost_tasks.csv and everything should be good.
4. Go onto ghost and import tasks, find the csv file and you're done
